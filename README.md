# UFOs
 
This is a project for the Lede Program at the Columbia Graduate School of Journalism.

For this project, I wanted to focus on web scraping and SVGs. My main data manipulations and web scraping were done through pandas and BeautifulSoup in a Jupyter Notebook. I  discovered an overwhelming love for RAWGraphs which gave me the base graph SVG layers, which I then add illustrations and styling into with Adobe Illustrator for a more compelling piece.

My overall analysis looked at three different aspects of the National UFO Reporting Center Database: UFOs by state, shape, and date. California is the top state for sightings, coming in at almost double the numbers of any other state. Sightings around the world aligned with current events including movie releases and COVID-19.

My top infographic showcases my overall findings in a mashup of visualizations, including a graphic representation of the real memo sent between Roswell, NM and Dayton, OH in 1947 regarding the 'original' flying disc. 

In future, I would like to work more with ai2html to make the code and fonts come through cleaner from Adobe Illustrator to my webpage. I would also like to add interactions and tooltips.
